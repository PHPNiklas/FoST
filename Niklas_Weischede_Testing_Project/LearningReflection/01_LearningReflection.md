> Please use the below questions as guidelines to help you think and plan your Learning Reflection Report

## 1. How was your experience testing the given Webapp?
- Testing the Webapp was engaging and intuitive, much like my regular use of GitLab and GitHub. It was a practical application of my software testing course learnings.
     

## 2. How did you write or manage your test case? Describe the process.
- Managing my test cases was a systematic process. I started with positive scenarios for each test case, ensuring they passed without errors. Then, I moved on to negative tests, trying to provoke errors in every input field and selection. I also tested the system’s response to repeated names in projects and issues. This approach helped me to document it effectively in the test cases.

## 3. Do you recommend any other tools or styles for Test case management. 
 - I did not use any extern other tools or styles for the text cases, but i know that they are various test case management tools out there which are probably helpful. Maybe it is interesting to try these tools for this type of assignment in the future.


## 4. Which IDE (Visual Code or Atom or else) have you used to edit files?
- I have used Visual Studio Code to complete this assignment. I have worked with Visual Studio Code since the beginning of my studies, so it was also very practical in this case.


     
## 5. Did you find any trouble? how did you solve the trouble?
- I did not not have any trouble solving this assignment, because the instructions were very clear. 


## 6. Did you find any trouble using Github? have you used Github before? where?
- I also did not have any trouble using Github, because i am used to working with it. I already used it very often in various courses at my hometown universit.
 

      

## 7. If in the future if you need to automate these test cases, which framework or language will you use? and describe why (Robot Framework, Cypress, Selenium, or any other )
- If i would automate these test cases, i would probably use the Open Source Robot Framework. I already heard of it in beforehand and it seems like a valid choice for such processes.



## 8. Kindly search the term `Tester` `Automation Tester` glassdoor and LinkedIn or any other job search website. Currently, list the skills and competencies that are most in-demand in software testing
- I found following key words: Analytical Skills and Attention to Detail, Technical Knowledge and Tool Proficiency, Effective Communication and Collaboration


## 9. **Let's assume** that if you are going to continue with the career in Software Testing, which technical and soft skills do you need to fill up the blank in your resume?
- Assuming I’m pursuing a career in Software Testing, I would  need to enhance my technical skills, particularly in scripting languages like Python or Java for automation testing. I would also focus on understanding software development. On the soft skills front communication and collaboration skills would be important for effectively working with various teams and managing even more important testing scenarios.




## 10. Write short Learning Reflection and  Free words Do you think that project helped in putting theoretical knowledge into practice? Describe? (is there anything else that you would like to share with us concerning the current study module). e.g. regarding the quality of content and your learning (or) improvement ideas? 
- In my opinion this course was a very interesting introduction course into software testing and i great opportunity to getting started with test cases. All the instructions over the lessons were very clear and understandable and even "solving" your first bug was enjoyable. Also i liked the distribution between the theoretical part and the practical part, so in the final project i could use my theoretical knowledge i got over the lessons.
